### Motivation
I work in a company that has a lot of Java developers that maintain Scala services. They use IntelliJ Idea and always read the ide highlights.
In our codebase we have dozens of `if (option.isDefined) option.get` constructions.
I believe it's not a Scala way to deal with Option. It would be great if Scala plugin for IntelliJ Idea added this check to the inspections.

In this repository you can find few examples that are pretty common in our codebase. I hope it's going to make your work easier and I hope to see this improvement soon. If you need any help please contact me.
Thanks!
